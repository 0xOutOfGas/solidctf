  We design a pretty easy contract challenge. Enjoy it!
  Your goal is to make isSolved() function returns true!

flag: flag{placeholder}

constructor:
  args: ["hello"]
  value: 0

#show_source: False # True by default(show source option available), or False for a reverse contract challenge

#solved_event: SendFlag # Default solved checker is isSolved() view function, but it also supports emitted event as the checker
