  We design a pretty easy contract challenge. Enjoy it!
  Your goal is to make isSolved() function returns true!

flag: flag{placeholder}

constructor:
  args: ["hello"]
  value: 0

#show_source: False      # True(show source option available) by default, set to False for a reverse contract challenge

#solved_event: SendFlag  # Default is using isSolved() view function as solved checker, but emitted event checker is also supported
