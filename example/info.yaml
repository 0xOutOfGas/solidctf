  We design a pretty easy contract challenge. Enjoy it!
  Your goal is to make isSolved() function returns true!

flag: flag{placeholder}

contract: Greeter # Contract class name not file name

constructor:
  args: ["hello"]
  value: 0

#show_source: False # True by default

#solved_event: SendFlag
